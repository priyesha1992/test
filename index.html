<p>This is a healthy pizza as the pizza base is made from whole wheat flour. everything except the mozarella cheese, is made from scratch including the paneer or cottage cheese.Even the pizza sauce is made at home. this is my preferred pizza sauce recipe.</p>

<p>when making this pizza, first make the pizza bread dough. when the bread is leavening, you prepare the paneer marinade and keep it for an hour….. and then get to make the pizza sauce. when the bread is doubled up and leavened you start assembling the pizza….. its that easy.</p>

<p>I have created two pic collage for the step wise pics and divided into three main steps – making the pizza dough, paneer tikka and the pizza tomato sauce.</p>
