Proof the yeast in warm water for ten minutes. then add the oil, salt and 1 cup flour.\r\n\r\n2. Stir with a spoon or spatula. add 1 cup flour more and stir again and you will see the mixture leaves the sides of the bowl. add the last 1 cup and using your hands begin to knead the flour.\r\n\r\n3.  Knead to a smooth, soft and elastic dough. rub water all over the dough and keep in the same bowl to leaven the dough. cover the bowl and keep aside.\r\n\r\n### Preparing the paneer tikka :\r\nWhisk the yogurt well. then add the all the spice powders and herbs. mix and fold in the paneer cubes, onions, tomatoes and the bell pepper. keep aside for marination for minimum 1 hour.\r\n\r\n### Making the pizza sauce:\r\n1. Puree the tomatoes. heat olive oil and saute the garlic for some seconds. add the tomato puree and saute for 3-4 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Then add chopped basil, dry oregano, black pepper and salt. stir and simmer for 2-3 minutes. keep the sauce aside.\r\n\r\n### Assembling the pizza:\r\n1. Divide the dough into two or three parts depending on the size of your pan. roll the dough into a circle or oval keeping a thickness of 1/4 inch. place the pizza base in a greased and dusted baking pan or tray. brush olive oil on the rolled pizza base.\r\n\r\n2. Spread the tomato pizza sauce on the pizza base. evenly arrange the marinated pizza and veggie cubes on the pizza.\r\n\r\n3. Sprinkle grated mozarella cheese on the pizza. bake the pizza in a pre heated oven at 250 degrees C for 15-20 minutes or more till the pizza base has been baked and cheese is browned.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the pizza from the oven and serve paneer tikka pizza hot with tomato sauce, red chili flakes and italian herb mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ********** Ready Paneer Tikaa Pizza **********\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
